	<h2>In this python project, we coded a scenery that includes a house and some trees. For the trees we used loop</h2>
	<h2> codes so drawing it would be easier. This project shows the sun moving across the screen, when it reaches the </h2>
	<h2>other side of the screen, it would change into the moon, It is similar to dusk changing to dawn, thus the name.</h2>

	<h2>We first import the turtle and the random module. After that is complete, we establish the screen’s background </h2>
	<h2>color and our pensize and pen color, along with the turtle shape and its initial size. We then add what constitutes</h2>
	<h2> an apple in our game, making it a red circle. We also add in a color list. Then move onto making the scoring system.</h2>
	<h2> Starting it at 0 and putting the score’s location on the screen in the upper right corner. Next, we set up a timer </h2>
	<h2> which runs for a total of 30 seconds and appears in the upper left corner. Afterwards we create the process that </h2>
	<h2>enables the apple to randomly appear on the map after the collision with the turtle, as well as how much the turtle </h2>
	<h2> grows after eating it (0.2). Past that, we enable the turtle’s trail to change color and the game to end once the timer</h2>
	<h2> runs out. Finally, we established the arrow key movements that allow the turtle to be moved in the first place.</h2>

	<h2>This was a game similar to the Shell Game. It would first ask you for you name, then give you different options like</h2>
	<h2>what color would you like the ball, and what difficulty/speed you would want the cups to move. After you answered the</h2>
	<h2> ball would go into one of the cups and move. You would try to follow the cup and guess where the ball was. If you guess</h2>
	<h2> correctly, you get to continue and have the option to change difficulty. However, if you get it incorrectly, the game </h2>
	<h2> will display the leaderboard screen and you name will be on if you got onto the leaderboards. </h2>

	<h2>We created a scratch game where you control a basketball by using arrow keys to move it up and down. Different objects</h2>
	<h2>will fly at you and you will try to avoid them. Each object that you successfully dodge will increase you score by one.</h2>
	<h2> When you do get hit by an object, everything will freeze and a game over screen will be displayed.</h2>
